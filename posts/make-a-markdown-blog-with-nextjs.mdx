## When to use Markdown?

Markdown is a great tool to create websites with dense content such as: blogs or documentation. It allows the author to spend less time coding HTML elements and CSS styles and more time to focus on the content.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js is a react framework that has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Site Generatior (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR). To create a blog (were most of the information is static) we will use SSG to generate all our blog pages at build time.

## Libraries

To code our Next.js markdown blog we will need a few libraries.

```
yarn add gray-matter
yarn add remark
yarn add remark-html
```

1. [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) is a front matter parser that will help us parse the metadata from the markdown files.
2. [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) is a markdown parser that will help us parse our markdown content into HTML.

## Let's begin:

The first step is to create a next application. To create a project, run:

```shell
npx create-next-app
```

Create a top-level directory called **posts**. Here we will store our markdown data. Let's begin by creating two posts.

```md:posts/first-post.md
---
title: Welcome to my first post
description: My first post
---
# Welcome to my blog!

This is my first post.
```

```md:posts/second-post.md
---
title: Welcome to my second post
description: My second post
---
# Welcome to my blog!

This is my second post.
```

Let's go back to the root folder and look a for folder named **pages**. Inside pages create a new folder called blog. Inside blog create a new file named [slug].js

For Next.js a file name with square brackets indicates that its a dynamic path. The name between the brackets will be used as a variable to generate new paths.

We create a blog folder so the route of our new blog will be `example.com/blog/[name-of-the-post]`

In [slug].js create a new react component named **Post** and create two asynchronous functions: **getStaticProps** and **getStaticPaths**.

```jsx:pages/blog/[slug].js
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

export default function Post() {
  return (
    <div>
      This is my Post Component
    </div>
  )
}

export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  return {
    paths:[],
    fallback: false,
  }
}

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  return {
    props: {},
  }
}

```

So why did we created these two functions? These two functions together will allow us to generate a page for each of our markdown files.

Let's begin with `getStaticPaths`

[getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) is used to pre-render specific paths. It returns an object that cointains two required properties: paths and fallback.

1. Paths is an array of objects that contains all generated url paths for every post. Each object should have a params object that contains the name of the dynamic file, in this case slug, with its path name.

2. Fallback is a boolean. If true Next.js will create a fallback page that the user will be redirected in case it doesn't find the requested path. If false it will return a 404.

For a static blog, we will set fallback to **false**, so in case the user enters a path that was not generated at build time I will return a 404 page. Here is an example of how the return should look like:

```js
return {
  paths: [{ params: { slug: 'path-1' } }, { params: { slug: 'path-2' } }],
  fallback: false,
}
```

This is how our final code for getStaticPaths looks like let's dive into each line to see what happening:

```js
const getStaticProps = async ({
  params: {
    slug
  }
}) => {
  const markdownWithMetadata = fs.readFileSync(path.join('posts',
    `${slug}.md`), 'utf8')
  const parsedMarkedown = matter(markdownWithMetadata)
  const htmlContent = await markdownToHtml(parsedMarkedown
    .content)
  return {
    props: {
      contents: htmlContent,
      data: parsedMarkedown.data,
    },
  }
}
```

1. readdirSync will read the folder posts and return an array with the name of the files that are inside.

```js
const files = fs.readdirSync('posts')
```

2. map will interate every element in files; remove the '.md' and return paths as an object.

```js
const paths = files.map((filename) => ({
  params: { slug: filename.replace('.md', '') },
}))
```

[getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) is used to pre-render the page content. It returns a props object which contains any information that we would like to pass to a component.

When used with getStaticPaths (like in this example) it requires an object as a parameter. Here is an example how the object looks like.

```js
export const getStaticProps = async (context) = {
  console.log(context)
  // context = { params: { slug } }
}
```

This is how our final code for getStaticProps looks like let's dive into each line to see what happening:

```js
export const getStaticProps = async ({
  params: {
    slug
  }
}) => {
  const markdownWithMetadata = fs.readFileSync(path.join('posts',
    slug + '.md'), 'utf8')
  const parsedMarkedown = matter(markdownWithMetadata)
  const htmlContent = await markdownToHtml(parsedMarkedown
    .content)
  return {
    props: {
      contents: htmlContent,
      data: parsedMarkedown.data,
    },
  }
}
```

1. Destructure the parameter in one line to get the slug.

```js
getStaticProps({ params: { slug } })
```

2. Use path.join to get the file path for the slug

```js
path.join('posts', slug + '.md')
```

3. readFileSync reads a file and converts it to a string

```js
const markdownWithMetadata = fs.readFileSync(path.join('posts', slug +
  '.md'), 'utf8')
```

4. Use gray-matter to parse the metadata and the content for a markdown

```js
const parsedMarkdown = matter(markdownWithMetadata)
```

5. Convert the parsed markdown content to html

```js
const htmlContent = await markdownToHtml(parsedMarkedown.content)
```

To make the code easier to follow I moved my markdownToHtml function into another js file but here is how it works behind the scenes.

```js
import {
  unified
} from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkHtml from 'remark-html'

const markdownToHtml = async (markdown) => {
  const processedContent = await unified().use(remarkParse).use(
    remarkHtml).process(markdown)
  return processedContent.toString()
}
```

Now that getStaticProps returns the props that we need we can populate our Post component.

```jsx:pages/blog/[slug].js
import Head from "next/head";

export default function Post({ contents, data }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{data.title}</title>
      </Head>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: contents }}></div>
    </>
  );
}
```

Congratulations, you have created your two first posts in your Next.js blog. Your [slug].js should look like this:

```jsx:pages/blog/[slug].js
import fs from "fs";
import Head from "next/head";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import markdownToHtml from "../../lib/markdownToHtml";

export default function Post({ contents, data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>{data.title}</title>
      </Head>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: contents }}></div>
    </div>
  );
}

export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const files = fs.readdirSync("posts");
  const paths = files.map((filename) => ({
    params: { slug: filename.replace(".md", "") },
  }));
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
};

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params: { slug } }) => {
  const markdownWithMetadata = fs.readFileSync(
    path.join("posts", slug + ".md"),
    "utf8"
  );
  const parsedMarkedown = matter(markdownWithMetadata);
  const htmlContent = await markdownToHtml(parsedMarkedown.content);
  return {
    props: {
      contents: htmlContent,
      data: parsedMarkedown.data,
    },
  };
};
```

All thats left to do is to run start you development server.

```shell
cd [name of your app]
npm run dev
```

Assuming that your server is running in port 3000, you can visit your [first-post](http://localhost:3000/blog/first-post) and [second-post](http://localhost:3000/blog/second-post)
